Algorithm and Data Structures Revision

This will include some of the common data structures used in Computer Science which will be written in C. 

Updates:
1. I will try to create the same data structures in other languages: Python and Java.
2. Try to post at least once a week.
3. Try to provide self-documenting code, and useful comments.
